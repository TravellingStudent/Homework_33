Hi, friends.
Here is my homework from module 33 of the DS course on SkillBox education platform.
This module about Airflow (so, I have DAGs) and prediction models(pipeline.py is testing different models and predict.py use the best model for obtian prediction).
I worked with car_price dataframe and predicted price category of cars.
